    "description": "This is a generic Shiny app which can display any data complying with the Darwin Core format (e.g. GBIF data). This Shiny app has been developped and is hosted in the same [Virtual Lab](https://blue-cloud.d4science.org/group/globalfisheriesatlas) provided by [Blue-Cloud 2026](https://blue-cloud.d4science.org) project which implements best practices for Open Science and FAIR data management:
                        * data: the default dataset used by this app is published on GBIF with following [DOI](https://doi.org/10.15468/23m361).
                        * code: code is open and freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/firms-gta/darwin_core_viewer) and main releases have been assigned DOIs on Zenodo .
                        * virtual environment: the R code combines the use of both renv package to snapshot the required environment and can be directly executed within the RStudio server hosted by the virtual lab. 
                        * team: this work is provided by [IRD](https://www.ird.fr/).
You can freely [register as a new member](https://blue-cloud.d4science.org/group/globalfisheriesatlas) of the virtual Lab if you want to learn more.",
