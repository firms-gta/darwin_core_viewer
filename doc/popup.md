This is a generic Shiny app which can display any data complying with the [Darwin Core format](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) (e.g. GBIF data). This Shiny app has been developped and is hosted in the same [Virtual Lab](https://blue-cloud.d4science.org/group/globalfisheriesatlas) provided by 
[Blue-Cloud 2026](https://blue-cloud.d4science.org) project which implements best practices for Open Science and FAIR data management:
* **data**: the default dataset used by this app is published on [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) with following [DOI](https://doi.org/10.15468/23m361).
* **code**: code is open and freely available on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/firms-gta/darwin_core_viewer) and main releases have been assigned DOIs on Zenodo. The code can be directly executed within the RStudio server hosted by the virtual lab. 
* **virtual environment**: the R code combines the use of both renv package and Docker container to snapshot the environment required to execute the app. 
* **team**: this work is provided by [IRD](https://www.ird.fr/).
You can freely [register as a new member](https://blue-cloud.d4science.org/group/globalfisheriesatlas) of the virtual Lab if you want to learn more.
